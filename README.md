This package enables the simulation of panel data with independent effects in the cross-section and cases (over time). The code is based on that used to simulate panel data in ["Identification and Interpretation of Within-unit and Cross-sectional Variation of Panel Data Models" by Jonathan Kropko and Robert Kubinec](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231349). The original code used to reproduce the paper's results can be found in the `sim_august2017.R` and `sim_august2017_graphs.R` files in the top-level directory of this repo.

Independently generating these two dimensions of variance in a panel data set permits much more robust consideration of how one-way and two-way fixed effects and random effects models handle TSCS/panel data. The package also enables the simulation of autocorrelation in either the over-time dimension and the correlation (spatial) dimension. This package is still under development.
